# Process Control - Tank
## Ailton Santos

This project creates a data acquisition block to collect the tank level value. The level value is then passed to a PID control object. The PID control object calculates the control signal using a PID algorithm. The control signal is then passed to an actuator object. The actuator object activates the actuator to control the tank level.
